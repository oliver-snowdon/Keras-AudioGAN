# Keras-AudioGAN
Using Generative Adversarial Networks for Audio Synthesis, Recognition and Processing

Work in progress. In this example, WavInfoGan is supposed to learn how to synthesise drum sounds and automatically categorise the sounds it makes. The training set can be downloaded from http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/cdonahue/wavegan/data/drums.tar.gz and the script can be run by calling

`python WavInfoGan.py`
